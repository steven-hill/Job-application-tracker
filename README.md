# Job application tracker

## A UIKit project to track job applications using CoreData.

### 
  - This app uses UIKit, and mixes storyboard and programmatic UI.
  - Users can add, view, delete and edit job applications via sheets. The dashboard view provides the user with information to track their applications at a top level.
  - I utilised UICollectionView to display the array of job applications to the user.
  - I implemented persistence with CoreData.
  - This project gave me further practice with the protocol and delegate pattern, and MVC.
